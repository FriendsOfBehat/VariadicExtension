Symfony 5.0 is not supported by Behat itself yet, need to wait for that first.

No problem! I created the PR so its ready when needed :)

@pamil Behat now has support for Symfony 5. Do you think you can reevaluate this PR now?

Looks like Symfony 5 requires PHP 7.2.5. How would you like to handle this? Do I simply remove the combination from  the test matrix or do we bump the PHP version in `composer.json` ?

I would say, that we need both ;)

How about this? Should be ok now.
